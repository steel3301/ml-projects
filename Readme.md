1. Perform the following operations using R/Python on suitable data sets: 
a) read data from different formats (like csv, xls) 
b) Find Shape of Data 
c) Find Missing Values 
d) Find data type of each column 
e) Finding out Zero's 
f) Indexing and selecting data, sort data,  
g) Describe attributes of data, checking data types of each column,  
h) counting unique values of data, format of each column, converting variable data type (e.g. 
from long to short, vice versa) 
 



 
2. Perform the following operations using R/Python on the data sets: 
a) Compute and display summary statistics for each feature available in the dataset. (e.g. 
minimum value, maximum value, mean, range, standard deviation, variance and 
percentiles 
b) Illustrate the feature distributions using histogram. 
c) Data cleaning, Data integration, Data transformation, Data model building (e.g. 
Classification)  
 




3. Visualize the data using R/Python by plotting the graphs for assignment no. 1 and 2. Consider 
suitable data set. Use Scatter plot, Bar plot, Box plot, Pie chart, Line Chart. 
 




4. Apply appropriate ML algorithm on a dataset collected in a cosmetics shop showing details of 
customers to predict customer response for special offer.  
Create confusion matrix based on above data and find 
a) Accuracy 
b) Precision 
c) Recall 
d) F-1 score 
 



5. Write a program to do following:  
Data Set: https://www.kaggle.com/shwetabh123/mall-customers 
This dataset givesthe data of Income and money spent by the customers visiting a shopping 
mall. 
The data set contains Customer ID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, Spending Score. Therefore, 
asa mall owner you need to find the group of people who are the profitable customers for the 
mallowner. Apply at least two clustering algorithms (based on Spending Score) to find the 
group ofcustomers. 
a) Apply Data pre-processing  
b) Perform data-preparation (Train-Test Split) 
c) Apply Machine Learning Algorithm 
d) Evaluate Model. 
e) Apply Cross-Validation and Evaluate Mode 
 




6. Assignment on Regression technique.  
Download temperature data from below link. 
https://www.kaggle.com/venky73/temperaturesof-india?select=temperatures.csv 
This data consists of temperatures of INDIA averaging the temperatures of all places month 
wise. Temperatures values are recorded in CELSIUS  
a) Apply Linear Regression using suitable library function and predict the Month-wise 
temperature. 
b) Assess the performance of regression models using MSE, MAE and R-Square metrics 
c) Visualize simple regression model. 
 




7. Assignment on Classification technique 
Every year many students give the GRE exam to get admission in foreign Universities. The 
data set contains GRE Scores (out of 340), TOEFL Scores (out of 120), University Rating 
(out of 5), Statement of Purpose strength (out of 5), Letter of Recommendation strength (out 
of 5), Undergraduate GPA (out of 10), Research Experience (0=no, 1=yes), Admitted (0=no, 
1=yes). Admitted is the target variable.  
Data Set: https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions 
The counselor of the firm is supposed check whether the student will get an admission or not 
based on his/her GRE score and Academic Score. So to help the counselor to take appropriate 
decisions build a machine learning model classifier using Decision tree to predict whether a 
student will get admission or not. 
a) Apply Data pre-processing (Label Encoding, Data Transformationâ€¦.) techniques if 
necessary.  
b) Perform data-preparation (Train-Test Split) 
c) Apply Machine Learning Algorithm 
d) Evaluate Model.
